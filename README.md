# CharityML-Potential-Donor-classfication-based-on-income-data

## Business Objective
In this project, several supervised machine learning algorithms have been implemented to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then, the best candidate algorithm out of the three tested algorithms from preliminary results have been chosen and further optimized to best model the data. The goal of this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.
